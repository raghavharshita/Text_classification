# Text_classification
This repository demonstrates text classification using a multi-nomial Naive Bayes Classifier. The IMDB dataset is used for this experiment.
# Features

#At the end of the experiment, one will be able to:

1) Perform different text processing techniques such as:
      Removing special .
      Removing stop words.
2) Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes model from the scikit-learn machine learning library to predict the sentiment ('positive' or 'negative') for a movie reviews dataset.

# usage
1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook Text_classification_using_naive bayes.ipynb in Google Colab.

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the text processing techniques, train and evaluate the Naive Bayes model.
